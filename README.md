## How to Deploy Docker: https://github.com/Super-Badmen-Viper/NineSong
You first need to download the compressed file from the [ninesong releases](https://github.com/Super-Badmen-Viper/NineSong/releases/)  

You need to put the. env and docker-compose.yaml files [in the same folder](https://github.com/Super-Badmen-Viper/NineSong/releases/). You can customize the parameter configuration of. env and docker-compose.yaml, such as mapping the media library folder to the Volumes of the NineSong container.  

Note that if you update the mirrored version of NineSong, temporary resources in the media library (such as album covers) will also be deleted. You need to rescan the media library in the settings to regenerate temporary resources
```sh
run: docker compose up -d
login mail: admin@gmail.com
login password: admin123
```
How to Thoroughly Reinstall NineSong: Need to Clear Data Together with Volumes in Docker.  
Because considering that the image upgrade cannot affect the database data, if you delete the containers of NineSong, the data in their databases will not disappear unless you clear it together with the data in Volumes in Docker.

## Author's Message
 - As this project is currently independently developed by Xiang Cheng(myself), programming standards are a personal habit of the Xiang Cheng(myself), and coding standards are not yet standardized enough. However, this project will continue to undergo self refactoring and reverse development. It can be affirmed that in the future, NSMusicS will form a standard coding specification, which will be beneficial for the community to develop third-party NSMusicS plugins, Enable NSMusicS to meet the diverse needs of more potential customers，Most importantly, NSMusicS will always be open source and continuously updated
 - The expectation of the NSMusicS series products is to enable people around the world to use free, open-source, and user-friendly music products
 - 大道之行，天下为公。人神恋歌，九歌韵世。

The Chinese name of the project is "Nine Song Music Super | 九歌音乐", abbreviated as NSMusicS<br> inspired by ["Chu Ci"] | 楚辞, to commemorate ["Qu Yuan"] | 屈原<br>
