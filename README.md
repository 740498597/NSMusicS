  <p align="center">
    A local music software that is expected to support multiple platforms with AI capabilities and multimodal features.<br>
    You can use software like MusicTag to embed album covers and lyrics into your local music files (mp3, etc.), and NSMusicS can perfectly read them

# Development Plan
 - ## After the completion of any of the following planning and development, except for NSMusicS (WPF), the completed projects will be separated into independent open source projects

 - ## NSMusicS
    - 1.(Windows) (Professional) MusicPlayer++
    - 2.Tens of Millions-song Level of Music Library Management on NAS
    - 3.Music and Entertainment Scenes(Recording karaoke and scoring.......)
    - 4.<font color="#40A688">Windows Music IDE, Similar to Adobe Audition</font> 
      1. identify songs module based on sound fingerprint technology (also open source as a separate project model)
      2. Guessing Your Favorite Module Based on Big Data User Behavior Analysis
      3. AI singing module based on nlp, replacing the sound of the song with your own (also open source as a separate project model)
      4. AI music notation module based on nlp (also open source as a separate project model)
      5. AI extraction of audio lyrics synchronization information based on nlp (breaking copyright barriers such as Krc and Qrc)
      6. Implement functions such as NSMusicS singing bar scoring and evaluation
 - ## NSMusicS_For_Knowledge_Graph
    - 1.Knowledge Graph+Machine Learning In NSMusicS

 - ## NSMusicS For Electron
    - The Electron version will serve as a dedicated music player.
    - Electron supports cross-platform usage on various operating systems, including Windows 10++, Linux (Ubuntu+, Synology NAS+Docker), MacOS, Android 11++, and iOS.
    - It shares the same features as NSMusicS, as described above.
      - However, it does not include a Windows music IDE similar to Adobe Audition.

 - ## MZMusic
    - ## unknown
